                The RTX 4090 is based on Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace architecture. It features
                16,384 cores with base / boost clocks of 2.2 / 2.5 GHz, 24 GB of memory,
                a 384-bit memory bus, 128 3rd gen RT cores, 512 4th gen Tensor cores,
                DLSS 3 and a TDP of 450W. Performance gains will vary depending on the
                specific game and resolution. With a 4090 tier card 1080p in-game fps
                will often get CPU bottlenecked which prevents the GPU from delivering
                higher fps. At higher (often sub-optimal) resolutions (1440p, 4K etc)
                the 4090 will show increasing improvements compared to lesser cards.
                When fps are not CPU bottlenecked at all, such as during GPU benchmarks,
                the 4090 is around 75% faster than the 3090 and 60% faster than the
                3090-Ti, these figures are approximate upper bounds for in-game fps
                improvements. The fact that the 4090 is currently the fastest performing
                graphics card available is reflected in its jaw-dropping MSRP of $1,600.

              The Radeon RX 7900 XTX is an enthusiast-class graphics card by AMD,
              launched on November 3rd, 2022. Built on the 5 nm process, and based on
              the Navi 31 graphics processor, in its Navi 31 XTX variant, the card
              supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that all modern games will
              run on Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Additionally, the DirectX 12 Ultimate
              capability guarantees support for hardware-raytracing, variable-rate
              shading and more, in upcoming video games. The Navi 31 graphics
              processor is a large chip with a die area of 529 mm² and 58,000 million
              transistors. It features 6144 shading units, 384 texture mapping units,
              and 192 ROPs. The card also has 96 raytracing acceleration cores. AMD
              has paired 24 GB GDDR6 memory with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which are
              connected using a 384-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a
              frequency of 1855 MHz, which can be boosted up to 2499 MHz, memory is

              The RTX 3050 is built on NVIDIA’s Ampere architecture. It marks the
              first time that ray-tracing has been available on an entry level
              (50-series) card. Second generation ray tracing cores can be switched on
              for more realistic light simulation, albeit at a hit to performance. The
              3050 features 2560 CUDA cores, a boost clock frequency of 1.78 GHz, 8 GB
              of the latest GDDR6 memory and NVIDIA’s DLSS. DLSS technology uses the
              3050’s tensor cores to scale up resolutions whilst maintaining high
              frame rates and without losing significant image quality. The 3050 also
              includes an encoder (NVENC) for sharper images and smoother capture

              Lake architecture with Socket 1700. Thanks to Intel Hyper-Threading the
              core-count is effectively doubled, to 32 threads. Core i9-13900K has
              36MB of L3 cache and operates at 3 GHz by default, but can boost up to
              5.8 GHz, depending on the workload. Intel is building the Core i9-13900K
              on a 10 nm production process, the transistor count is unknown. You may
              freely adjust the unlocked multiplier on Core i9-13900K, which
              simplifies overclocking greatly, as you can easily dial in any
              overclocking frequency. With a TDP of 125 W, the Core i9-13900K consumes
              a lot of power, so good cooling is definitely needed. Intel's processor
              supports DDR4 and DDR5 memory with a dual-channel interface. ECC memory
              is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical
